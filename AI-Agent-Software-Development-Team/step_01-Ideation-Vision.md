# Steps

# 🧠 Step 1: Ideation & Vision

## 🎯 Primary Goal of Step 1

To **define the "why"** behind the project — clearly and compellingly — before any technical solution is proposed. This includes:

- Establishing the **problem space** and user pain
- Defining **who benefits**, and **how**
- Exploring **possibilities and variants**
- Checking **alignment with strategy, mission, and opportunity**
- Identifying **assumptions and risks** early

## 🧩 Key Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Clarity of Problem** | Do we truly understand the user need or gap? Can we describe it in 1–2 sentences? |
| **Articulation of Vision** | What’s the ideal outcome or product we wish existed? |
| **Exploration of Landscape** | What already exists? Have others solved this in a way we can learn from or improve upon? |
| **Strategic Fit** | Does this idea align with our capabilities, goals, or market interest? |
| **Creative Exploration** | Could we solve this problem in alternate or novel ways? Are we assuming the right constraints? |

## ❓ Key Questions to Ask

### 💡 Problem Space

- Who has this problem? What do they currently do to solve it?
- Is this a daily annoyance, a critical failure, or a nice-to-have?
- Why now? What has changed that makes this problem worth solving today?

### 🧭 Strategic Alignment

- How does this idea align with our broader goals?
- Is this something we’re uniquely positioned to build?
- Does it complement our existing products/services?

### 🧠 Creativity & Alternatives

- What’s the brute-force version? What’s the elegant version?
- What other ideas solve the same problem, maybe in very different ways?
- Are there upstream problems we could fix instead?

### 🔍 Prior Art & Competition

- Are there existing tools that do this already?
- What are the limitations or flaws in those tools?
- Could we extend or integrate rather than compete?

### ⚠️ Risks & Constraints

- What might make this project fail?
- What assumptions are we making?
- Is the problem technically feasible or just desirable?

## 🧠 Brainstorming Other Ideas

Explore variant or parallel ideas that:
- Solve the problem differently (e.g., passive vs active discovery)
- Reframe the problem (e.g., visibility vs protocol)
- Serve the same audience more effectively

## 📚 Prior Art Exploration

Conducted by the **Project Strategist** or **Technical Researcher**, including:
- Open-source and commercial alternatives
- Existing vendor tools
- Community practices and forum advice

## 📝 Deliverables

| File | Section |
|------|---------|
| `01_vision.md` | Problem statement, vision narrative, primary user |
| `01_vision_logbook.md` | Idea variants, competitor notes, rejected options, risks |
| (Optional) `01_prior_art.md` | List of prior tools, strengths/weaknesses |

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Visionary

Defines the core idea, inspiration, and purpose behind the project. They champion the "why" and imagine the future impact.

- Describe the problem and opportunity
- Paint a compelling vision of success
- Help define target users and emotional goals
- Tell the “Why this? Why now?” story
- Translate gut feeling into a document others can evaluate
- Avoid being solution-focused too early

### Project Strategist

Evaluates the business and strategic value. Anchors the idea in reality: market need, fit with company goals, risk vs reward.

- Perform prior art research
- Write strategic justification
- Identify assumptions and risks
- Contribute to the vision logbook
- Ground the vision: will anyone pay for this, use it, share it?
- Survey what’s already out there
- Identify strategic risks before technical ones

### User Advocate

Represents the end user’s perspective. Ensures that the problem is framed with empathy, clarity, and real-world grounding.

- Refine user pain points
- Draft initial user stories
- Identify user constraints / environment
- Vet the idea for practical value
- Ensure the project solves a real problem
- Offer alternate perspectives (what would a technician in the field actually want?)
- Highlight edge cases, constraints, environment




## ✅ Exit Criteria

This step is complete when:

- The problem, vision, and target users are clearly defined
- Value and feasibility are supported
- No obvious better alternative exists
- The team agrees the idea is worth deeper exploration
