# ✅ Step 6: Testing & Validation

## 🎯 Primary Goal of Step 6

To rigorously test implemented features against their requirements, ensure system stability and usability, and validate that the software delivers its intended value. Testing is both **technical (correctness, stability)** and **experiential (user validation, real-world scenarios)**.

This step ensures confidence in the product’s functionality and correctness before public release or broader internal adoption.

## 🧩 Key Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Functional Testing** | Ensure each feature works as described in its PRD. |
| **Integration Testing** | Verify that modules communicate and coordinate correctly. |
| **Edge Case & Error Handling** | Validate system robustness under stress and invalid inputs. |
| **User Validation** | Observe real users interacting with the tool, gather feedback. |

## ❓ Key Questions to Ask

### 🧪 Test Coverage
- Are there automated tests for every major function?
- What types of tests are in place (unit, integration, end-to-end)?
- Are failure conditions tested (timeouts, invalid input, partial success)?

### 🧰 Manual QA & Review
- Are test cases documented?
- Can someone follow a checklist to manually validate core workflows?
- What bugs or inconsistencies have been discovered?

### 🧠 Real-World Validation
- Has anyone unfamiliar with the project used the tool?
- Where did users struggle, misunderstand, or break the system?
- Are logs, telemetry, or user feedback available?

## 👥 Participating Roles (4 of 10)

| Role | Description | Step 6 Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Senior Developer** | Oversees automated testing infrastructure and contributes deep test coverage. | - Write or extend unit and integration tests<br>- Validate technical correctness and coverage<br>- Fix implementation bugs |
| **Project Planner** | Coordinates testing milestones, QA sessions, and user validation. | - Schedule and track testing sessions<br>- Organize feedback loops<br>- Document test logs and status |
| **User Advocate** | Observes and interprets real-world user feedback. | - Conduct internal or pilot user tests<br>- Capture usability issues and pain points<br>- Propose changes or clarification |
| **System Designer** | Ensures implemented features still match the original architecture. | - Review final data flows and module interactions<br>- Validate error handling and fallback logic<br>- Flag architectural drift |

## 📝 Deliverables

| File | Contributed by | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `tests/` | Senior Developer | Updated test suites (unit, integration, system) |
| `06_test_report.md` | Project Planner | Summary of testing activities, known issues, resolved bugs |
| `04_prds/feature_<name>.md` | All roles | Annotated with test outcomes, caveats, or unexpected discoveries |
