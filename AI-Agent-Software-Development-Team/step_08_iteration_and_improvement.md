# 🔁 Step 8: Iteration & Improvement

## 🎯 Primary Goal of Step 8

To analyze user feedback, system performance, and internal observations to improve the product. This includes refining existing features, fixing newly discovered issues, and potentially introducing small enhancements — all grounded in real-world use.

This step closes the loop from release to refinement and feeds into future planning.

## 🧩 Key Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bug Resolution** | Fix any issues uncovered post-release. |
| **Feature Refinement** | Adjust or polish features based on user feedback and observed behavior. |
| **Usability Enhancements** | Improve ease of use, reduce confusion, and enhance UX. |
| **Process Feedback** | Improve internal workflows, documentation, and delivery cadence. |

## ❓ Key Questions to Ask

### 🐛 Bug Handling
- What bugs have been logged post-release?
- Which ones are critical to resolve now?
- Are there any regressions from earlier builds?

### ✨ Feature Refinement
- Which features caused confusion or under-delivered on expectations?
- What could be removed, simplified, or clarified?
- Are new edge cases or user stories emerging?

### 📈 Metrics & Observations
- Are we seeing unexpected usage patterns?
- Is the system performing at scale or under stress?
- Are there improvements to performance or reliability that could be made?

### 🛠 Internal Process Review
- What slowed down or complicated development?
- Were there gaps in documentation, review, or testing?
- How can the team move faster or smarter next cycle?
