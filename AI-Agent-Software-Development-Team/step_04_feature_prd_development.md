# 🧾 Step 4: Feature PRD Development

## 🎯 Primary Goal of Step 4

To create **clear, structured Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)** for each MVP feature. These PRDs ensure alignment between stakeholders, define expectations, and serve as the canonical reference during development, testing, and review.

This step connects business needs (Step 1), technical strategy (Step 2), and architecture (Step 3) into implementable feature-level documents.

## 🧩 Key Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Feature Definition** | Describe what each feature does, who it's for, and how success is measured. |
| **Requirements Specification** | Break down each feature into user stories, acceptance criteria, and edge cases. |
| **Ownership & Dependencies** | Identify responsible team members and external/internal dependencies. |
| **Traceability** | Ensure each feature traces back to a user need and architectural component. |

## ❓ Key Questions to Ask

### 🎯 Scope & Purpose
- Who is this feature for?
- What problem does it solve?
- How does it support the broader product vision?

### ✅ Requirements & Completion
- What must be true for this feature to be considered complete?
- Are there performance, error-handling, or edge-case requirements?
- How will this feature be tested and verified?

### 🧩 Technical Details
- What inputs/outputs does the feature require?
- What modules or APIs does it depend on?
- How does it interact with the architecture from Step 3?

### ⚠️ Constraints & Risks
- What limitations should developers keep in mind?
- Is there any known complexity or uncertainty in this feature?
- Is a prototype or spike needed before full development?

## 👥 Participating Roles (4 of 10)

| Role | Description | Step 4 Responsibilities |
|------|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Project Planner** | Oversees scope alignment and consistency across PRDs. Tracks dependencies and priorities. | - Ensure each MVP feature has a PRD<br>- Organize PRDs into milestone groups<br>- Maintain traceability to roadmap |
| **System Designer** | Adds architectural guidance and validates feasibility. | - Align PRDs with system components<br>- Highlight integration paths and interface boundaries |
| **Software Architect** | Reviews technical clarity and verifies adherence to architectural principles. | - Ensure PRDs include sufficient abstraction<br>- Flag scope creep or misuse of architectural patterns |
| **Senior Developer** | Reviews implementability and estimates effort. Suggests refinements based on practical experience. | - Confirm feasibility<br>- Estimate effort and complexity<br>- Contribute to edge cases and testing scenarios |

## 📝 Deliverables

| File | Contributed by | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `04_prds/feature_<name>.md` | Project Planner (lead), all roles contribute | Individual PRD for each MVP feature, including scope, requirements, and risks |
| `04_feature_index.md` | Project Planner | List of all features, links to PRDs, status, owners |
| `01_vision_logbook.md` | All roles | Continue logging rationale, PRD evolution, and rejected options |

## ✅ Exit Criteria

- Every MVP feature has a complete PRD in `04_prds/`
- Each PRD includes: problem, user story, requirements, completion criteria, risks
- PRDs are reviewed and approved by System Designer, Architect, and a Developer
- The `04_feature_index.md` provides an overview of scope and ownership
