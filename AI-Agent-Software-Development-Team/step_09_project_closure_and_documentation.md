# 📚 Step 9: Project Closure & Documentation

## 🎯 Primary Goal of Step 9

To formally wrap up the current development cycle by consolidating all documentation, closing out outstanding tasks, reflecting on team and process learnings, and preparing the project for future maintainers or iterations.

This step ensures the project is **well-documented, repeatable, and transferable**, even if the current team steps away.

## 🧩 Key Objectives

| Objective | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Documentation Finalization** | Ensure all key decisions, files, and knowledge are properly recorded. |
| **Knowledge Transfer** | Make it easy for new team members or stakeholders to onboard. |
| **Retrospective** | Conduct a structured reflection on what went well and what can be improved. |
| **Project Archival** | Tag stable releases, mark completed phases, and clean up the workspace. |

## ❓ Key Questions to Ask

### 📄 Documentation Quality
- Are all PRDs, architectural decisions, and planning docs up to date?
- Are there README files or onboarding notes?
- Is the codebase annotated and structured clearly?

### 🧠 Knowledge Transfer
- Can someone new understand how the system works?
- Are known issues or future todos clearly marked?
- Are there guides for testing, deployment, and debugging?

### 🔍 Retrospective & Process
- What went well in this project?
- What bottlenecks or challenges were encountered?
- What should we do differently next time?

### 🗂 Archival & Versioning
- Are final deliverables tagged and backed up?
- Is the codebase stable, testable, and maintainable?
- Are there plans or timelines for future development?
